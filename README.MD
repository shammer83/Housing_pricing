## Project 2: Predicting House Prices with Advanced Regression TechniquesÂ¶
The goal of this project is for you to use EDA, visualization, data cleaning, preprocesing, and linear models to predict home prices given the features of the home, and interpret your linear models to find out what features add value to a home! This project is a bit more open-ended than project 1.
